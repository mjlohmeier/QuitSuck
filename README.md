# QuitSuck

Quit, Suck, QuitSuck (FizzBuzz variation)

As a cartoon dog named Jake once said, sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something.

QuitSuck means embracing the suck, and letting yourself quit when rest is needed.

It's also a fun problem to play with. The pliable nature of QuitSuck's namesake, FizzBuzz, means that this repository can be very, very extensive.

I'm doing this to teach myself algorithms and data structures, which everybody knows you absolutely must be able to talk about with confidence, or you will never get a job at a big tech company, ever.

Feel free to PR :)
